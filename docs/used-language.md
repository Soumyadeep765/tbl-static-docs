# What Language Does TeleBotHost Use?

TeleBotHost uses **TBL (Tele Bot Lang)** to build Telegram bots.

TBL is the native language of TeleBotHost and is designed specifically for Telegram bot development.

## What is TBL?

TBL (Tele Bot Lang) is a lightweight scripting language made only for Telegram bots on TeleBotHost.

Its syntax is **JavaScript-like**, so if you already know JavaScript basics, you can start using TBL immediately.

## Why TBL Instead of Node.js or Python?

TeleBotHost does not run raw Node.js or Python code.

Instead, it uses TBL, which runs inside a secure and optimized sandbox built only for bot execution. This makes bot development simpler and safer.

Benefits of using TBL:
• Better security  
• Faster execution  
• No server or VPS needed  
• Built-in Telegram bot features  

## JavaScript-Like Syntax

TBL feels familiar to JavaScript developers.

Example: 

```js
Bot.sendMessage("Hi");
```

You write simple logic, and TeleBotHost handles everything else in the background.

!!! tip
    If you already know JavaScript and are familiar with it, TBL will feel like a toy for you.
