## HTTP Instance

The **HTTP instance** allows your bot to make **external API requests**.

It is used to communicate with services outside Telegram, such as third-party APIs or your own servers.

With the HTTP instance, your bot can:

- Send GET and POST requests
- Fetch external data
- Send data to external services
- Handle API responses flexibly

The HTTP instance is mainly used for **external integrations**.
